### Instructions for importing our Model and running our Python Code

1. Download Zip File (JazzberryJamDemoSubmission.zip)

2. Unzip the folder in your chosen directory

3. Using a shell program, "cd" into the unzipped directory

  3.5 if you do not have python3 installed (The program will not run on python 2),
      intall python3 (Current Version: 3.10.4) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4. Open the desired evaluation map in CoppeliaSim

5. Load the model (Plower.ttm) into the scene

6. Position "Plower_Base" to [0, -6.25, 0]. (Ensure rotations are [0, 0, 0])

7. Start the coppeliaSim simulation

8. Run plower.py In the shell program by: ("py plower.py" or "python3 plower.py")

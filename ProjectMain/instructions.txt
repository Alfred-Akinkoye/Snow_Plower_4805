### Instructions for importing our Model and running our Python Code

1. Download Zip File (JazzberryJamDemoSubmission.zip)

2. Unzip the folder and "cd" into it

3. if you do not have python3 installed (The program will not run on python 2), 
    intall python3 (Current Version: 3.10.4) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

4. Open the desired evaluation map in CoppeliaSim

5. Load the model (Plower.ttm) into the scene and position "Plower_Base" to [0, -6.25, 0]. (Ensure rotations are [0, 0, 0])

6. Start the coppeliaSim simulation

7. Run plower.py ("py plower.py" or perhaps "python3 plower.py")
